# WP Plugin Activation Manifest

Lock down the activation state of individual plugins based on environment with minimal effort.

## Usage

Create a YAML file that defines the plugin activation state you want to enforce. Name it whatever you wish and put it wherever you want (
ideally outside of the webroot). Add this file to your project's repository. Example manifest file:

```yml
# top level keys are the environment
some_environment:
  enable:
    - someplugin/someplugin.php
  disable:
    - someotherplugin/someotherplugin.php
  # supports multisite
  network-enable:
    - someplugin/someplugin.php
  network-disable:
    - someplugin/someplugin.php
# 'global' is a special key that you can use to apply to all environments
global:
  enable:
    - woocommerce/woocommerce.php
    - wpmandrill/wpmandrill.php

development:
  disable:
    - wpmandrill/wpmandrill.php

```

Install
`composer require primetime/wp-plugin-activation-manifest`
Execute the mandate

```php
require('vendor/autoload.php');
// ...
// after WordPress is loaded - eg: within an mu-plugin
// ..
\Androlax2\WordPress\PluginManifest\Activation::set('path/to/plugin-manifest.yml', getenv('WP_ENV'));
```

In the example above, `WP_ENV` is an environment variable defining the name of the environment (eg: development, staging, production). This
environment name should match to a top-level key in the yaml file. Environment configuration is applied after the `global` configuration and
will take precedence over it. That's it!
